1. Arduino Uno compatible Board
2. Arduino IDE (1.0.6 or newer)
3. USB Cable
4. LIDAR-Lite Sensor

## Installation
1. Download Repository and open with Arduino IDE

### LIDARLite PWM Connection Setup
LIDARLite Cable | Arduino Pins
:---|:---
5V | 5V
PWR EN | _(Unused)_
MODE | Connect to 1kÎ© Resistor and Pin #3
SCL | _(Unused)_
SDA | _(Unused)_
GND | GND

*Connect the other side of the resistor to Pin #2.*

## Usage

1. [Connect an Arduino](#arduino-setup) and upload code
2. Open the serial monitor (Make sure baud rate is set to 9600)
3. The distance measured in centimeters (cm) will print to the serial monitor
